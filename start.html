            The object of the game is to identify a 'Set' of three cards from 12 cards
                laid out on the table. Each card has a variation of the following four features:<br>
                  (A) COLOR: Each card is red, green, or purple.<br>
                  (B) SYMBOL: Each card contains ovals, squiggles, or diamonds.<br>
                  (C) NUMBER: Each card has one, two, or three symbols.<br>
                  (D) SHADING: Each card is solid, open, or striped.<br>
                  A 'Set' consists of three cards in which each feature is EITHER the same
                  on each card OR is different on each card. That is to say, any feature in
                  the 'Set' of three cards is either common to all three cards or is different
                  on each card.<br>
                  <br>
                  <em>For example, the following are 'Sets':</em><br>
                  All three cards are red; all are ovals; all have two symbols; and all
                  have different shadings.<br>
                  All have different colors; all have different symbols; all have different
                  numbers of symbols; and all have the same shading.<br>
                  All have different colors; all have different symbols; all have different
                  numbers of symbols, and all have different shadings.<br>
                  <br>
                  <em>The following are not 'Sets':</em><br>
                  All have different colors; all are diamonds; all have one symbol; however,
                  two are open and one is not.<br>
                  All are squiggles; all have different shadings; all have two symbols;
                  however, two are red and one is not.<br>
